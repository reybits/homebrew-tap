# Homebrew Tap for My Utilities

This repository provides a Homebrew tap with custom CLI tools and utilities developed by me. With this tap, you can easily install and update these tools using Homebrew.

## Installation

First, add the tap:

```sh
brew tap reybits/homebrew-tap
```

Then, install a specific tool:

```sh
brew install reybits/tap/toolname
```

## Available Tools

- `simple-viewer-gl` – Simple Viewer GL is a simple and tiny image viewer based on OpenGL.
- `texture-packer` – Texture Packer efficiently packs images into a texture atlas.

## Updating

To update the tap and installed tools, run:

```sh
brew update && brew upgrade
```

## Uninstallation

To remove a tool:

```sh
brew uninstall reybits/tap/toolname
```
